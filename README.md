# The Racial Wage Gap (1973-2022)
This project, created during my first year of college, analyzes the relationship between wages and education, focusing on racial disparities in the United States from 1973 to 2022. By examining trends and wage gaps among different racial groups with bachelor's degrees, this analysis sheds light on social and economic inequalities.

# Description
The project aims to explore how race and education affect income using a dataset that provides information on wages categorized by education level, gender, and race. Through data visualization and linear regression models, the project seeks to gain insight into social and economic inequalities to inform policy-making and advocacy for greater economic equality.

## Getting Started
- Dependencies
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Installing
Clone the repository:

```

git clone https://github.com/estvjana/The-Racial-Wage-Gap-1973-2022-.git


```


## Navigate to the project directory:

```


cd The-Racial-Wage-Gap-1973-2022-t


```

## Install the required packages:

```

# Key Findings
### Income Disparity: 
White individuals tend to earn more on average than Black and Hispanic individuals, indicating systemic inequalities within the labor market.

### Education's Impact: 
Obtaining a bachelor's degree offers economic benefits regardless of race, although disparities persist.

### Economic Trends:
Recessions and economic policies impact wage gaps, sometimes marginally reducing disparities.

# Context and Implications
The analysis highlights the persistent wage gaps based on race among individuals with bachelor's degrees.
The findings can raise awareness about the need for equal pay and address systemic inequalities in the labor market. 
The insights gained can inform efforts to promote fairness, diversity, and inclusion in the workforce.

# Ethical Considerations

### Harms: 
Potential misinterpretation and misuse of data can lead to incorrect conclusions and harmful decision-making. It is crucial to use the data to identify disparities and promote equality rather than perpetuate discriminatory beliefs.
### Benefits: 
The research can help identify which racial groups need income equality and provide evidence for advocacy and policy changes.

# Conclusion
The project concludes that White individuals with bachelor's degrees make more income compared to African Americans and Hispanic individuals with the same level of education. While all racial groups experience income growth over time with a bachelor's degree, the wage gap persists, highlighting the need for continued efforts to address these disparities.
